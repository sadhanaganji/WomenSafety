ABSTRACT: We see many incidents are happening on women, but its taking long time to for police officials to reach the location/they are not being informed about the situation, so the idea rises here that, why can’t the people near by that location be informed because they can reach to that location faster and can actually stop the situation getting worse.This can be achieved by sending a notification to the near by user, that contains the location of the victim So for this problem we introduced an Android application, Women Safety which allows the user who is in need for help can get help through single click, which on clicked immediately checks the nearby other Women Safety app registered users location and sends them the notification, once the other user clicks on notification it shares the location of victim quickly and can be rescued safely. In between the application also sends SMS to the saved contacts in the application.

FUTURE EXTENTIONS: Capturing the images both from front and rare camera and sends them to registered email ids continuously for every 15 minutes until the “stop” button in the application is clicked, So that the images clicked can be used for futher investigation.
